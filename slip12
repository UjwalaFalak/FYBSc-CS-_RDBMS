Consider the followingr Department-employee database. 
Department (dno integer, dname varchar(20),city varchar(20)) 
Employee (eno integer, ename varchar(20), salary money) 
Department and Employee are related with a one to many relationship 
i. Write a function to accept department city as input and returns the total number of departments in that city. 
create or replace function f_no(text) returns text as'
declare
cnt int;
begin
select count(*) into cnt from dept where city=$1;
return cnt;
end;’
language ‘plpgsql’;
 
ii. Write a cursor to display the department-wise names of employees whose salary is between 50000 and 70000. 


iii. Write a trigger before inserting an employee record in the Employee table. Raise an exception if salary < 0. 
create or replace function e_fun()
returns opaque as'
begin
if(new.salary<=0::money) then
raise exception''salary of employee  should be greater than zero'';
end if;
return new;
end;'
language 'plpgsql';

create trigger trig_emp
before insert on emp
for each row
execute procedure e_fun();
