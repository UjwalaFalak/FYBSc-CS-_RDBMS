Teacher( t_no int, t_name varchar(20), age int, yr_experience int)
Subject (s_no int, s_name varchar(15))
Teacher and Subject are related with many to many relationship

declare
nm text;
c1 cursor for select tname from teacher,subject,t_s where teacher.tno=t_s.tno and subject.sno=t_s.sno and sname=$1;
begin
open c1;
loop
fetch c1 into nm;
exit when not found;
raise notice''%'',nm;
end loop;
close c1;
return null;
end;'
language 'plpgsql';
