Consider the following database 
Student (Roll_No int, Sname varchar (20), Sclass char (10)) 
Teacher (T_No int, Tname char (20), Experience int) 
The Student and Teacher are related with many to many relationship with the descriptive 
attribute Subject. 
i. Write a trigger before inserting the teacher record into a teacher table. Experience should be a minimum of 4 years. If it is less than 4 
years trigger gets fired and displays an appropriate message. 
create or replace function exp()
returns opaque as'
begin 
if (new.experience < 4 ) then
raise exception ''Teachers experience should be minimum 4 years'';
end if;
return new;
end;'
language 'plpgsql';

create trigger trig_exp
before insert or update on teacher
for each row
execute procedure exp ();

ii. Write a cursor to accept the student name from the user as an input and give list of subjects taken by the student. 

iii. Write a stored function to find the details of the maximum experienced teacher. 
create or replace function f_c() returns int as'
declare
r teacher%rowtype;
begin
select * into r from teacher where exp=(select max(exp) from teacher);
raise notice ''% % %'',r.tno,r.tname,r.exp;
return null;
end;'
language 'plpgsql';
